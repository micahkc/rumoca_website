# Rumoca Internals

Welcome to the Rumoca developer guide.

## What is Rumoca?

Rumoca is a Modelica compiler written in Rust. It compiles Modelica models to Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) and can simulate them or generate code for other backends.

Key features:
- **Fast parsing** with excellent error messages
- **LSP support** for IDE integration (VSCode, web)
- **WASM target** for browser-based tooling
- **Simulation** with multiple solver backends
- **Code generation** via customizable templates

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for developers who want to:
- Understand how the compiler works
- Fix bugs or add features
- Add new LSP capabilities
- Extend code generation backends

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:
- Rust programming
- Basic compiler concepts (parsing, AST, type checking)
- Git and GitHub workflows

Familiarity with Modelica is helpful but not required - we'll explain the relevant concepts as needed.

## Architecture and Contribution Rules

Normative architecture and contribution rules live in `spec/`, not in this
guide. Start with `spec/README.md` and follow the required reading list in
`AGENTS.md` before editing compiler or runtime code.
